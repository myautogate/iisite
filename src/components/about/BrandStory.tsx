          Invisible Intercom™ was born out of a vision to simplify the way property owners manage visitor access. 
          Founded by Dave White, a passionate business owner and innovator in the fields of automatic gates and 
          access control, he set out to create a solution that was not only cutting-edge but also accessible 
          and practical for everyday use.

        <p>
          With a focus on simplicity and reliability, Invisible Intercom™ offers a unique solution that operates 
          independently of traditional phone lines and internet connections, providing seamless communication 
          through a dedicated number, QR code technology, and a basic phone.

          Having operated AutoGate Electric for over 20 years, Dave and his team have gained invaluable insights 
          into market dynamics and customer needs. They have witnessed a variety of implementations, some successful 
          and others less so, with none quite achieving the right market fit for the majority of their clients.

          The team at AutoGate Electric has provided a great proving ground for the initial version of Invisible 
          Intercom and supporting early clients. Matt has been instrumental in bringing the latest version of 
          Invisible Intercom™ to life. Together with Dave and a small team of developers, they have developed 
          a completely rebuilt product with a purpose-built design and methodology.

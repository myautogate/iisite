          The idea of Invisible Intercom™ came in 2019 by Dave, who recognized a gap in the market for a more 
          efficient and user-friendly intercom system. Drawing on his extensive experience with AutoGate Electric, 
          Dave leveraged his expertise to create a product that would meet the needs of modern property owners 
          and small businesses alike.

          The initial product launch was met with enthusiasm, as early adopters praised the system's ease of use 
          and reliability. As the company grew, so did its commitment to innovation, leading to the development 
          of additional features such as remote gate/door control, video support, license plate recognition, 
          IFTTT integrations, and so much more.

          Today, Invisible Intercom™ continues to expand its reach, focusing on the Greater Washington DC area 
          and soon, nationwide. With plans to integrate with property management software and develop a native app, 
          the company is poised to remain at the forefront of the visitor access control industry.
